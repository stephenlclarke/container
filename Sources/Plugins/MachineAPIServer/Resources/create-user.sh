# First-time container user setup. Intended to be container machine-agnostic
# by directly manipulating /etc/group, /etc/passwd, and /etc/shadow rather
# than relying on image-specific tools (useradd, adduser, etc.). Also
# populates the home directory from /etc/skel and grants passwordless sudo
# access.
#
# Expects CONTAINER_USER, CONTAINER_UID, CONTAINER_GID, and CONTAINER_HOME to
# be set in the environment.
