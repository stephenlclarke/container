/// A handler for one stage of the build protocol.
///
/// The build pipeline multiplexes a single bidirectional gRPC stream between
/// the macOS host and the builder shim. Each packet carries a stage tag;
/// a handler claims packets for its stage via ``accept(_:)`` and processes
/// them via ``handle(_:_:)``.

/// Drives a build session by routing packets from the builder shim to the
/// appropriate handler.
///
/// ## Three-tier architecture
///
/// Builds involve three components with distinct responsibilities:
///
/// **macOS host (`BuildPipeline` / its handlers)**
/// Serves resources to the builder shim over a bidirectional gRPC stream.
/// Responsibilities include:
/// - Packing requested build-context files into a tar archive (``BuildFSSync``).
/// - Proxying image-layer blobs from the local content store (``BuildRemoteContentProxy``).
/// - Resolving and pulling base images (``BuildImageResolver``).
/// - Relaying builder stdout/stderr to the terminal (``BuildStdio``).
/// - Enforcing the context root boundary: directory traversal uses `openat(O_NOFOLLOW)`
///   at every descent step, and every individual file request resolves symlinks to their
///   canonical path before verifying containment within the context root.
///
/// **Builder shim (`container-builder-shim`)**
/// A Go process running inside a Linux VM that bridges the host gRPC stream
/// and BuildKit's `filesync` gRPC interface. Responsibilities include:
/// - Receiving the context tar from the host, unpacking it to a local cache,
///   and presenting the result to BuildKit via `DiffCopy`.
/// - Applying dockerignore exclusions (received from BuildKit as
///   `exclude-patterns` metadata) when walking the unpacked cache.
/// - Passing `followpaths` from BuildKit to the host so the host knows which
///   context paths to include in the tar.
///
/// **BuildKit**
/// Parses and executes the Dockerfile. Responsibilities include:
/// - Sending `Walk` requests with `followpaths` derived from each `COPY`/`ADD`
///   source and `exclude-patterns` derived from `.dockerignore`.
/// - Dereferencing symlinks, recursing into directories, and applying all
///   other COPY/ADD transfer semantics on the unpacked context the shim provides.
///
/// ## Packet flow
///
/// ```
/// BuildKit ──► shim DiffCopy ──► host Walk  (tar of context files)
///                            ◄── tar archive
///          ◄── PACKET_STAT per file (after shim unpacks + filters)
///          ──► PACKET_REQ for each regular file
///          ◄── PACKET_DATA (shim reads from local unpacked cache)
/// ```
